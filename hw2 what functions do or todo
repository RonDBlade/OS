1.implement the pipe part of foreground programs
2.background are still working when ./myshell is closed,is that ok?
4.instead of point 3(below),after doing background and opening foreground,trying to do foreground again doesnt work
(NOT ALWAYS???)3.doing foreground,trying to do another foreground(not working which should not work),closing foreground with ctrl+c,
opening background makes everything stuck.in the start other programs work ok but sometimes after it gets stuck and output/program is kept
buffered until the background is killed?????
